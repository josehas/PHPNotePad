PHPNotePad

The idea is very simple: to store information really easily without loging in or
anything and to have that information really easily accessible on the web 
anywhere, at any time. I thought what better way to do that than a simple 
notepad. This is a very simple web based notepad. Just start typing. That's it. 
It automatically saves text. There is nothing else to do. And you can access it 
from anywhere and any place.
